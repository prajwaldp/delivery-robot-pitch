title: Human Imitating Robot
description: The robot has arms with mechanisms to pick up parcels from a locker after authenticating on the person's behalf. It then places this parcel into a container on it and goes to the person's location to allow the person to pick it up after another stage of authentication. This mechanism is fairly sophisticated and will take a lot of fine tuning to get right. However, the existing lockers don't have to be modified.
