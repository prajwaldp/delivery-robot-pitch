title: Mobile Locker
description: The delivery robot itself consists of lockers. When a person wants a delivery, the delivery robot goes to the person's location, identifies the person and allows the person to authenticate himself/herself. On successful authentication, the corresponding locker opens, allowing the person to take the parcel. Other lockers should be available at the hub to facilitate the addition of new parcels.
