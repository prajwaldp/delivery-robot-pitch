title: Locker with loading mechanism
description: The locker has additional mechanics that, after authentication by the delivery robot on the person's behalf, places the parcel into a container on the delivery robot. The delivery robot goes to the person's location to allow the person to pick it up after another stage of authentication. The loading mechanism consists of a tray in each locker that ejects out when a locker is opened. A robotic arm attached to the locker pushes the parcel into the container on the delivery robot.
